Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass had decided they would like us to help them create a system in the form of a website that will provide students with online practice exams, and the ability to book on the road training.
What did you do particularly well?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I had trouble putting together the powerpoint presentation, so i would revise that.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
